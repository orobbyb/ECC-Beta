    <h2> Collecting Policy </h2>
    <p>The Codes of Ethics Collection of the Center for the Study of Ethics in the Professions collects codes of ethics, codes
      of conduct, and ethical guidelines from the following entities.</p>
    <ul class="collection">
      <li class="collection-item">Academic organizations </li>
      <li class="collection-item">Businesses </li>
      <li class="collection-item">Industry associations </li>
      <li class="collection-item">Fraternal organizations </li>
      <li class="collection-item">Government organizations </li>
      <li class="collection-item">Non-profit organizations </li>
      <li class="collection-item">Professional associations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Documents and guidelines included in the collection must be written by an established professional association, fraternal
      club, business, etc., and be the official policy of that organization. In some circumstances, we will include model
      codes of ethics that have been developed through a research project or workshop. However, a footnote will be attached
      to these codes clearly explaining how they were developed, and who is responsible for the codes’ content.</p>
    <p>For example, in 2010 we received permission to include the <a href="http://ethics.iit.edu/ecodes/node/4391"> Code of Ethics for Robotic Engineers </a>in
      our collection, a code that was developed by a team of undergraduate students from Wooster Polytechnic Institute’s
      Electrical and Computer Engineering and Robotics Engineering Department.</p>
    <p> If you know of a code that we should have in our collection or have any questions, please <a href="http://ethics.iit.edu/ecodes/contact"> contact us</a>      with your comments and suggestions.</p>

    <h4>Copyright Policy</h4>
    <p>In 1998, when we began posting codes of ethics online, we decided that instead of only providing links to codes of ethics,
      we would attempt to post the full text of codes on our site. As some scholars are interested in studying the development
      of codes over time, this approach has proven to be extremely valuable. We now have a number of codes of ethics that
      are unavailable anywhere else on the Internet.</p>
    <p>To make sure we comply with the wishes of the authors of these codes, we always ask permission to reprint each code before
      it is posted in this collection. A copy of the letter or email requesting copyright permission to repost a code of
      ethics is shown below.</p>

    <div class="letter">
      <p>Dear Colleague,
        <br><br>We are writing to request copyright permission to include the National Academies of Practice Ethical Guidelines
        for Professional Care and Services in a Managed Health Care Environment in our Ethics Codes Collection at the Center
        for the Study of Ethics in the Professions (CSEP) at the Illinois Institute of Technology.
        <br><br>Begun in 1996 with support from the National Science Foundation, the Ethics Codes Collection now contains
        over 3,000 codes from 1,500 different organizations. In January of 2016, the Center received a generous grant from
        the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation to enhance the Ethics Codes Collection. This grant will help the
        ECC serve as a more dynamic global resource for informing ethical decision making in professional, entrepreneurial,
        scientific, and technological fields, and inform critical research into the advancement of ethical practices in a
        rapidly changing world.
        <br><br>The Ethics Codes Collection is currently available at <a href="http://ethics.iit.edu/ecodes/">http://ethics.iit.edu/ecodes/</a>
        <br><br>As we update and expand the collection, we seek permission from organizations for recent and historical versions
        of their codes of ethics. Including all editions of codes that are available is especially useful so that the development
        of codes over time may be studied. We will link to your organization’s homepage so users may learn more about your
        organization, and invite you to submit more information about your organization that we will include on our site.
        Of course, copyright by your organization is always retained.
        <br><br>We hope that you will allow us to include your code in our online collection so that interested persons all
        over the world can learn more about your organization and its ethical standards.
        <p>Please complete the brief form available at <a href="http://ethics.iit.edu/codes/permission%20letter.pdf">http://ethics.iit.edu/codes/permission%20letter.pdf</a>,
          and send it along with a copy of any codes of ethics or other information you would like to include in the Ethics
          Codes Collection to my attention at <a href="mailto:cseplibrary@iit.edu"> cseplibrary@iit.edu</a>.</p>
        <p>We look forward to hearing from you.</p>
