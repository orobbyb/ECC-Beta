## What is the Ethics Code Collection?
The Ethics Codes Collection (ECC) is the largest database of codes of ethics and guidelines in the world. It contains over 2,500 individual codes from around 1,500 different organizations, and collects both current and historical versions of these documents. The ECC seeks to provide practitioners, students, scholars and the public access to codes of ethics and guidelines and in this way inform ethical decision making in professional, entrepreneurial, scientific, and technological fields.

## Goals
  The goal of this project is to redesign the Ethics Code Collection Web Portal to achive 3 things

**Easier to Navigate:**

  The old sites links were unintuative this site aims to have the view be able to quickly find where they need to go with better routing     and navigation bar.

**Easier to Search:**

  The old site used a basic text search which was not always optimal. This version uses Elastic Search to allow for more advanced    queries.

**Easier to View:**

  The old site was not mobile responive or clean. This version will look nice on any sized screen.
